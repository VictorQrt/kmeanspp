# kmeanspp

This repo contains my implementations of the kmeans clustering algorithm in different languages.
It is a constant work in progress, as part of my learning process of said languages.

- You can generate a CSV dataset by running ./generate_dataset.sh <number_of_points>.
- All of the binaries will generate a out.csv file from the dataset, where points are associated to clusters.
- Run ./csv_to_svg.sh <output_csv> to get a out.svg file to visualize the clustering.
